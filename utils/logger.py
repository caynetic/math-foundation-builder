# utils/logger.py
# Centralised logging for the Math Learning App.
#
# Why logging instead of print():
#   - With PyInstaller --windowed there is no console, so print() output
#     disappears silently. Logging writes to a file instead.
#   - Log file location: <data_dir>/app.log
#   - All modules import `logger` from here and call logger.info() / error()
# =============================================================================

    Configure and return the root application logger.

    - Writes to <data_dir>/app.log  (always)
    - Also writes to the console    (development only, when not frozen)
    - Log level: DEBUG in development, INFO in packaged app

    Call this once from the web app entry point before serving requests.
    Returns the configured logger so startup code can hold a reference.
