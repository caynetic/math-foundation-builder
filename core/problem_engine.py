# Central dispatcher — given a subject, topic, and difficulty, returns
# a fully formed problem dict ready for the GUI to display.
#
# IMPORTANT — PyInstaller safety:
#   All imports are EXPLICIT and STATIC.  No importlib, no __import__(),
#   no string-based dynamic loading.  PyInstaller's static analyser must
#   be able to see every module at build time or it won't bundle them.
#
# Problem dict contract (every generator must return this shape):
# {
#   "question":    str,   the problem text shown to the student
#   "answer":      any,   the correct answer (numeric, str, etc.)
#   "hint":        str,   level-1 nudge (shown in practice mode)
#   "hint2":       str,   level-2 partial solution
#   "hint3":       str,   level-3 full method walkthrough
#   "explanation": str,   full worked solution shown after answering
#   "type":        str,   "numeric" | "multiple_choice" | "expression" | "inequality"
# }
